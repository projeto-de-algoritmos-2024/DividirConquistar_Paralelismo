THIS HERE CONTAINS THE .md FOR !documentation
purposes! AND THAT'S THAT.
PRETTY PLZ, DO NOT PUT ANY DAMN CODE HERE!!1!
THAT SHOULD GO INTO SRC.

Basically this.

### Introduction - what is this document

This document explains what precisely is inside this folder

This folder contains the following structure:
    - Locvst -> locvst's code documentation
    - aqelabatata -> aqelabatata's code documentation

Documentation here is used in a somewhat loose way. 
It is more precisely defined as code formatted commentary and
holds the thought process that went into making the src. 

That's that.


### Locvst's callsign:

Violence! :>
